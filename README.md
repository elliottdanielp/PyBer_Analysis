# PyBer_Analysis
With matplotlib

## Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

As we can see from the DataFrame the Rural area having less total drivers then Suburban and Urban area's they are able to charge more per ride giving the drivers of the Rural area's a average fare per ride of $34.62 and an average fare per driver of $55.49. The biggest takeaway from the DataFrame is the more total drivers an area has the less the average fare per driver will be.

As for the summary chart we can quickly see that Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We can also see that there is a week in February that has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time.

## Summary and Recommendations:

1. Because there are more total drivers than total rides in the Urban city types, the Urban drivers may not have enough work to support themselves. PyBer may want to consider investing in some advertising in the Urban citys to increase the total rides or risk losing Urban drivers.

2. The results of the summary DataFrame could be due to Urban city types being more compact, which collects a lower average fare per ride, while Rural city types are more spread out, which would collect a higher average fare per ride. 

3. PyBer should work to include mileage distance data as part of the data collection process and analysis to help find if there is a corallation betweeen the total rides vs average fare. Without knowing the average distance per ride its hard to say.
